CPN
Example - May be like processes

Db Marriage
process - db and merging and the problems which are discussed

Remind Andy
RDB - theory



Chapter 1 - Introduction
->

Chapter 2 - Theory of CPN
->Runnig Example - Abstract Version
->CPN version - without markings - CPN def. without the initialization function
->Multisets
->CPN Version - With Markings (Marked colored petri nets) - CPN def. with initialization function.

-> Taxi Example - CPN version and abstract version - Theory of CPN and describing the connection with the example. Similar to jensen book
-> use the current CPN version and then explain the different version, hardcode and predefine data domain for certain variables. and the net acquires those
-> Semantics - Define Reachability graph and then construct


Chapter 3 - Extending CPN with Realtional Data
-> Motivation to add RD to CPN, why do we need to have processes to data. - From the paper - Very short
-> limitations - data is limited, and data component can be more and more. Bring DB, taxi management after bringing the database, in abstract terms.
-> 1st version of the paper - Explain what DB nets are - using section 2.
-> implement concept of DB nets - my task
-> introduce the relational extension the classical CPN
-> -> what is RDB (query answering and first order query), What is view place - definitions, What is now in the transition.
-> DB nets example - version 2 of the paper. extension in the CPN. executable version

Chapter 4 - Implementation
-> Architeture
-> Data Acquisition -> getting data from outside -> using Comms -> Try to show different versions of the the functions such as Leave Phone Number and Get Random.
-> Adding query of functionality to the net, update the db ->-> How to work to the DB?? how transitions are handled (attaching queries) how view places are handled.
Executed by the simulator.
-> Example of the net - final version -running along
-> Appendix - write the doucmentation

Chapter 5 - Execution and Analysis
-> Execution of the net - step by step simulation with screenshot.
-> State Space Generation - classical analysis techniques that one could extract. Show small examples of failing state spaces on smaller nets. Explain the approaches - 2-3 approaches taken for the same - failed. Ugly one - if success then fine else put it in failure too

Chapter 6 - Conclusion
-> Summary
-> Future Work
