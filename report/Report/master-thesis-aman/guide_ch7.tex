\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}

\paragraph*{\textnormal{The idea of DB-nets was coined by Rivkin and Montali in their paper titled \bdq{DB-Nets: on The Marriage of Colored Petri Nets and Relational Databases}\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/DBNets}. In the paper, the authors emphasise on the theory behind different aspects of DB-nets and define it as an extension of Coloured Petri Nets. In this thesis, we implement the concept of DB-nets on the tools which are available for modelling, simulation and verification purposes. In this theory, we also present a lightweight theory related to the modelling of DB-nets in practice. However, in practice, we adopt the execution semantics similar to Coloured Petri Nets.}}

\subparagraph*{\textnormal{While calculating state spaces, we failed a few times and still do not have a clear solution for analysing DB-nets. We would like researchers to take up the task and look for a clean solution in future. In terms of practical application, one could also develop an extension which calculates the state space and export the results. In future, we could also help in setting benchmarks, by performing simulation over DB-nets, over which one could perform pattern recognition or process mining over them. We invite researchers to build up on this topic.}}
