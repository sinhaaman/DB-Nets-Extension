The integration of business processes and its related data is considered challenging in today's world. Until now, the business processes and the related data are viewed as separate entities and hence processed separately, although some data might be related with the business process. An attempt to integrate master data with business processes is made by Rivkin and Montali in \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/DBNets}. In this thesis, we develop a light weighted theory around the concept of DB-nets, a relational extension of Coloured Petri Nets, introduced in \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/DBNets}. We develop an extension in CPN Tools, a tool which provides modelling, simulation and verification environment for Coloured Petri Net models, to model and simulate DB-nets. Additionally, we also try to perform verification tasks over the given DB-nets model. This thesis is based on implementation of the theory on DB-nets introduced in \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/DBNets}.
