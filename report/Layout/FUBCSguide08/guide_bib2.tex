According to FUB-CS standards a chapter containing bibliographic

It is specified by:
\begin{verbatim}
  \begin{thebibliography}{XX}
    <your list of \bibitems>
  \end{thebibliography}
\end{verbatim}

\bibitem{Comment}
If you do not want numbers, then you can you can use, for instance, the very nice and powerful \texttt{natbib} package and have the references listed like the four below (and many options to vary citation in the text), or manually specify something like
\begin{verbatim}
\bibitem[L94]{Lamport}
\end{verbatim}
in your bibliography list to get \verb|[L94]| both in the text and between the square brackets in the bibliography.
